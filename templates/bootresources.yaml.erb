## Boot image download configuration.
##
#
# Items in this configuration:
#
# boot - the root for these settings.
#
#   storage - location on the filesystem where boot images are stored.
#
# These images can get quite large: some files are hundreds of megabytes,
# and you may need multiple copies for different architectures, OS releases,
# etc.
#
#   sources - one or more sources of downloadable boot images.
#
# Each source downloads from one simplestreams URL, though it is possible to
# have multiple sources using the same URL.
#
#     path - for each source, the path to its (online) Simplestreams data.
#
#     keyring - for each source, a GPG keyring to verify images' signatures.
#
#     selections - for each source, one or more sets of constraints for images.
#
# From each source, only those images are imported which match at least one of
# the source's selections.  A selection can specify an OS release, a CPU
# architecture, and so on.
#
# Be careful: the items in a selection will multiply.  For example if you
# specify architectures "i386" and "amd64", and subarchitectures "generic",
# "hwe-s", and "hwe-t", the import script will need to import 6 images, for
# each possible combination.  If you only want some of those combinations,
# keep them as separate sources and/or selections.
